          Since 1989, Intuit (maker of Quickbooks, Mint, and TurboTax) has run a
          “Follow me Home ” program that involves questionnaires, observations,
          interviews, etc. with the actual users at workplaces where Intuit’s
          products are being used. The goal of the program is to find out how
          customers use the product, what they like and don’t, and what
          challenges they may have.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          And what does Intuit do with all these insights? They change, modify,
          or tweak their products. Not kidding. For instance, the 2006 version
          of one of their products, Quicken, had 121 customer-recommended
          improvements. [Source]

          Harley-Davidson has carefully adjusted the voices of its motors to
          please its customers’ ears. In fact, they have sued competitors who
          have imitated their motor voices.

          The ability to get into your customers’ shoes results in user empathy.
          Intuit and Harley-Davidson are just two of the many companies
          worldwide that have mastered the art of empathy in User Experience
          (UX) design.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          Empathy is a foundational principle in the concept of design thinking
          – a user-based approach to problem-solving that combines hands-on
          testing of a product or service with the actual users.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Empathy is thus a crucial factor in UX design because it involves the
          usability and function of products, and services in the environment of
          the users. Empathy allows product design teams to identify which ideas
          need more testing before they commit to a development or re-design
          project.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          The story is told of a local cafe in London that was particularly
          concerned about the complaints the staff was getting about ‘really bad
          tea. The first and most obvious conclusion that the cafe owner made
          was that the chef was only three months old. But he couldn’t afford to
          fire the new chef. So the owner introduced the concept of MYOT (make
          your own tea) and put it on the menu. Those who opted for MYOT were
          given hot water in a teapot, a side of milk, sugar, and three kinds of
          tea leaves. The customers were also asked to set aside a tiny cup of
          the tea they made for the staff to taste later.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          After many MYOTs, the owner instructed the chef to brew two types of
          tea leaves, one stronger and one lighter. Interestingly, those who
          preferred a stronger tea had an Irish background, while those who
          preferred their tea lighter were mostly London natives.

          In case we haven’t made it obvious already, empathy is crucial in UX.
          However, it does not appear to come naturally to designers in general,
          and especially to UX designers. In fact, 2009 research stated that
          professionals working in the technology field have lower empathy. When
          there’s a disconnect between a designer and the end user, the product
          or application may fail.
