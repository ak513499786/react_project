          When Ole Kirk Christiansen went out of business back in the 1930s,
          little did he know that the scraps from his furniture factory would
          help build a whole new business during the world recession. Ole along
          with his son Godtfred founded Lego (meaning ‘put together’ in Latin) -
          a company that sold toys made of fine wood.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          However, after a decade of selling those toys while braving the Great
          Depression and the Second World War, Godtfred felt this business model
          wasn’t quite right. Lego was not the only toy-producing company.
          Meanwhile his father Ole couldn’t get his mind off of a brick-like toy
          made of plastic, that he had seen many years ago in a business
          exhibition. Both the men put together the idea and created what Lego
          is today - a set of building blocks that allows children to put their
          imagination to work.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          The no-code creation in a website and application development is
          perhaps moving in the Lego direction. A kind of app development that
          allows creative freedom to build apps without much technical
          knowledge.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          The No-code revolution is indicative that modern businessmen and women
          want to keep creative control in their own hands when it comes to
          developing websites or mobile applications. No-code is really for the
          businesses who wish to personalize their product or service branding,
          and it does not mean that no-code platforms can only produce simple
          apps.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">A no-code revolution is brewing</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Forbes reported in 2021 that “60% of all custom apps were being
          developed outside of the IT department while 40% of these users worked
          in a professional setting.” Many businesses today are opting for
          no-code creation for several reasons, one of them being faster time to
          market.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">What are no-code platforms?</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          No-code tools or platforms are basically programming styles and
          methodologies that do not require coding. Instead, these platforms use
          GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools to create websites or mobile
          applications. A user does not need to be either a coder or a developer
          but someone who knows the basics of using keyboard tools such as
          click, drag, drop, and scroll.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">Benefits of no-code</h1>
        <span className="empathy-sub-heading">
          1. Better allocation of IT/engineer hours :
        </span>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          - Since no-code platforms are more like drag-and-drop tools, business
          users need not employ coders and engineers in the website and
          application development. This technical workforce then can be applied
          towards mission-critical work.
        </p>
        <span className="empathy-sub-heading">2. Faster time to market :</span>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          When it comes to developing a business website or a mobile
          application, a business needs to go through several rounds of
          approvals and iterations. With no-code platforms, the task can be
          allotted only to a few employees after approvals from the upper
          management. This reduces the approval and development time, and your
          product or service may come out in the market in much less time.
        </p>
        <span className="empathy-sub-heading">3. Cost reduction :</span>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Through no-code environments, you can create more applications in less
          time and resources, which leads to lower costs. It also reduces the
          costs of hiring since coders or developers are not needed for
          launching web or mobile apps.
