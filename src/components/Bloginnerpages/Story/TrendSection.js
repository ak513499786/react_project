          A relatively new player pulled off a potentially risky storytelling
          marketing campaign in the late 2000s. Today, the campaign is a case
          study for marketing enthusiasts across all sectors because of its ‘X’
          factor.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          In 2009, UK-based BGL Group’s insurance price comparison website -
          Compare The Market - began telling humorous stories from the
          perspective of an animated anthropomorphic Russian species meerkat.
          The meerkat was named Aleksandr Orlov as the sophisticated founder of
          the website comparethemeerkat.com. Many advertisements appeared on
          YouTube, television, and other video platforms about Orlov’s
          frustration over the confusion caused to his website by another
          website called comparethemarket.com.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Each of those stories told in the adverts was funny, and managed to
          send across the message that "everybody was logging on to
          comparethemarket.com, but his website was comparethemeerkat.com - a
          dating, and socializing website for meerkats." Each story ended with
          Orlov explaining the difference, and ending his dialogue with
          "simples”.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The company managed to generate a strong buzz about its brand through
          humorous storytelling, while creating the impression that they were
          already famous. As a result, the website became the fourth most
          visited insurance website in the UK in 2009, while their sales doubled
          at the end of the campaign.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">How does storytelling in marketing work?</h1>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">1. Evokes the right feelings</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Customers don’t buy products or services, they buy the feeling that
          the said product or service evokes within them. Harvard Business
          School professor Gerald Zaltman, in his book, quotes a study that
          claims 75% of purchase decisions are subconscious, and therefore,
          customers are more likely to convert through emotion-driven campaigns.
          The emotions that the above company evoked were FOMO (fear of missing
          out), and many people logged on to their website out of curiosity.

      <div className="empathy-content">
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">2. Shows the ‘how’ </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Of course, every marketing rep knows the importance of 'how'. But when
          the ‘how’ is presented in the form of a story, it has better
          retention, and can provoke action. In the case of content marketing,
          it takes the customer closer to a purchase decision.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">3. Does not feel like marketing</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          You are now dealing with possibly the most aware set of customers with
          dwindling attention spans. They are discrete about the time and energy
          that they spend, and so in-your-face marketing naturally repels them.
          The one factor that still has the power to hold their attention is a
          good brand story that does not feel like marketing.

          How to tell great brand stories that work?
        </h1>
        <h2 className="epathy-sub-heading">1. Reward the customer</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          As we discussed above, the ‘how’ factor is everything in telling a
          brand story. But that ‘how’ needs to show what the customer will
          receive. A principle that all great storytellers follow is this -
          reward the reader/viewer/audience.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Your target customers should feel rewarded at the end of the story in
          the form of -
          <div className="points">
            <p className="empathy-para">- a satisfactory solution, or</p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              - the value the product or service brings, or
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">- a discount code, or</p>
            <p className="empathy-para">- a loyalty program, or</p>

      <div className="empathy-content">
        <h1 className="empathy-sub-heading">2. Pack an emotional punch</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          There’s no telling a story without emotion. Consciously list down the
          feelings that you would want your customers to get while watching the
          story.

        <h1 className="empathy-sub-heading">3. The truth factor</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The story that you create may be fictional or a case study, but it
          should still tell the truth in terms of its message. Try not to not
          claim things your marketing team cannot pull off later. Be truthful to
          your brand, and the value it brings. Follow this principle in all your
          branding or digital marketing campaigns.

        <h1 className="empathy-sub-heading">4. Connect with the audience </h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          A Harvard Business Review study revealed that across a sample of nine
          industry categories, fully connected customers turned out to be 52%
          more valuable than those who were just satisfied with the product.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          This is how you can do that -

          In his New York Times bestseller ‘The Confident Speaker," Harrison
          Monarth has stated: "A story can go where quantitative analysis is
          denied admission: our hearts. Data can persuade people, but it doesn’t
          inspire them to act; to do that, you need to wrap your vision in a
          story that fires the imagination and stirs the soul."
