          An interesting study published by Think With Google described how
          Domino's and Diageo tackled ‘unintended bias’ in 2022. A significant
          observation that the study made was about how brands miss out on
          potential audiences on YouTube, and other channels by over-excluding
          certain keywords.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          For instance, some brands stay away from words that the LGBTQ
          community relates to in order to avoid hate speech online. However,
          since YouTube has been actively taking steps against any kind of
          specific audience, such exclusions block such brands from reaching out
          to many potential buyers.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The study then elaborated on how Domino’s and Diageo partnered with
          YouTube to actively fight against such bias, and engage as diverse an
          audience as possible.

          While YouTube is notorious for constantly changing algorithms, digital
          marketing in general has also continually evolved. Businesses often
          find themselves on edge, catching up to what’s changed and what
          remains in online marketing.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">Customer experience over keywords</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          This trend became a reality in 2022 when businesses saw Google’s AI
          search becoming more and more humane. As a result, content that really
          helped users or searchers began trending instead of keyword-heavy
          content. This will mature in 2023 as search engines evolve, and become
          more customer/user-oriented. It may be time you stop pleasing Google,
          and start pleasing your customers online.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          Videos are not just about vertical or horizontal formats anymore. They
          are about getting more information in less time. Instagram Reels is
          just one of the many channels where your relevant customers are. Reels
          say a lot about your customers. Let’s see -

              - your customers want information or entertainment, but they don’t

        <p className="empathy-para">
          Make 2023 the year you start producing short-form video content. Begin
          with personalized content such as your team activities, your inner
          workings, and your business routine, and eventually switch to your
          value propositions.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">The Metaverse</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Since some of the biggest brands, such as Starbucks and Nike, have
          jumped on the bandwagon of the metaverse, this may become a huge trend
          in 2023. Metaverse is like a parallel virtual world where people and
          brands interact with each other, albeit more immersively. It is slowly
          becoming a place where a lot of customers want to be. However, most
          businesses do not have a practical use case. Just as it happened with
          augmented reality and virtual reality applications back in 2018, the
          metaverse may or may not find relevance in all business sectors.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          A wise step would be to study the metaverse as a user in 2023,
          interact with other users, and find out relevant areas for your
          business. It is okay if you don’t use the metaverse at all for digital
          marketing in 2023. However, this should be the year of collecting as
          many use cases for your business as possible.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          If short-videos are any indication, the attention span of your
          customers is getting worse by the day. Users today consume information
          like snacks - it needs to provide instant gratification and satisfy
          their hunger for knowledge or information. While long-form content
          will never lose its significance, you must experiment with bite-sized
          and easily digestible content in 2023, especially to lure your online
          customers.

          trends for your business. Let your customers be your guiding light
