          The website redesign of the restaurant chain, Chili's, is a great case
          study in UX design using Gestalt Psychology. The company wanted to
          create a more modern and user-friendly website that would make it
          easier for customers to find information about their menu, locations,
          and promotions.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The redesign incorporated several Gestalt psychology principles,
          including proximity, similarity, and closure. The menu items were
          grouped together based on their category, such as appetizers, entrees,
          and desserts, using the principle of proximity. The use of consistent
          fonts, colors, and layouts throughout the website provided a sense of
          similarity, making it easier for users to recognize and remember
          important information. The use of visual cues, such as icons and
          images, helped to provide closure and guide users through their
          journey on the website.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          In addition, the website's homepage featured a large image of Chili's
          famous Baby Back Ribs, which utilized the principle of figure-ground
          relationship by making the main content stand out against the
          background. The design also incorporated the principle of continuity
          by using a horizontal scroll to display featured promotions, allowing
          users to easily navigate through the content.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The result of the website redesign and development was a more visually
          appealing and user-friendly website that made it easier for customers
          to find information and navigate through the site. With the
          incorporation of Gestalt psychology in website redesign, Chili’s
          experienced an increase in online orders from 25% to 55%, apart from
          an increase in customer engagement.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">What is Gestalt psychology?</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          As UX designers at Codelinear, our primary goal is to create a
          user-friendly and intuitive experience for the users of our clients.
          One way to achieve this goal is by using Gestalt psychology principles
          in UX design.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Gestalt psychology is a psychological theory that explains how humans
          perceive visual elements as a whole instead of individual parts. In
          this blog post, we will explore how Gestalt psychology can inform your
          UX design choices.

                1. Figure-Ground Relationship <span> </span>
              </strong>
              The Gestalt principle of figure-ground relationship explains how
              our brain separates the visual elements in a design into
              foreground and background. This principle in UX design helps the
              user to identify and differentiate between the main content and
              the surrounding elements. As a UX designer, you can use this
              principle to create a clear visual hierarchy on your webpage or
              application, making it easier for users to navigate and find the
              information they need.
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              <strong className="opacity-70">2. Proximity </strong>
              Proximity explains visual elements that are close to each other as
              related. In UX design, this principle can help you to group
              related elements together, making it easier for users to
              understand their relationship. For instance, you can group related
              options or actions together, such as placing all the editing tools
              close to each other in a photo editing app. In the case of Chilis,
              the menu items were regrouped based on category.
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              <strong className="opacity-70">3. Similarity </strong>
              The principle of similarity, as the name suggests, is about
              perceiving elements that share similar attributes, such as color,
              shape, or size, as related. As a UX designer, you can use this
              principle to create consistency in your design by using similar
              colors, shapes, or sizes for related elements. For instance, you
              can use the same color for all the buttons that have the same
              function, such as the "Add to Cart" buttons in an e-commerce app.
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              <strong className="opacity-70">4. Closure </strong> The closure
              principle explains how we see visual elements that are incomplete
              as complete. This principle helps you to simplify complex
              information by using visual cues that suggest completion. For
              instance, you can use a progress bar to show the user how much of
              a task is completed, giving them a sense of closure and a clear
              indication of how much work is left.
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              <strong className="opacity-70">5. Continuity </strong>
              The continuity principle describes how users perceive factors that
              are arranged in a continuous line or curve as related. This
              principle is helpful in creating a smooth and effortless user
              experience by using visual cues that guide the user's eye from one
              element to another. For instance, Chili’s used a horizontal line
              to separate different sections of a webpage or an application,
              making it easier for users to navigate.
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              <strong className="opacity-70">6. Symmetry </strong>
              The symmetry principle is about how we perceive symmetrical
              elements as related. This principle helps designers to create a
              sense of balance and harmony in the design by using symmetrical
              shapes and layouts. For instance, you can use a symmetrical layout
              for your website or application, creating a sense of order and
              simplicity that is pleasing to the eye.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">The take-away</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Gestalt psychology principles can inform your UX design choices by
          providing you with a deeper understanding of how users perceive visual
          elements as a whole. By using these principles in your design choices,
          you can create a user-friendly and intuitive experience for your
          users, making it easier for them to navigate and find the information
          they need. As a UX designer, it is important to keep these principles
          in mind when creating your designs, as they can have a significant
          impact on the user experience.
