          Only a few months ago, would you have ever imagined that Twitter would
          be bought by SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk? But the real story is
          not written by Musk but was written by a group of people back in 2006.
          Former Google employees Evan Williams and Biz Stones alongwith
          mastermind Noah Williams began a podcasting platform called Odeo, but
          then Apple launched its podcasting platform (through iTunes) before
          they did.

          So along with another team member Jack Dorsey, the three friends
          decided to launch Twitter - an SMS service platform. But the investors
          did not like their MVP, and the team had to test the prototype among a
          small group of users to finally launch it at the right time. If Musk's
          recent poll (Should he continue as the Twitter CEO?) is any
          indication, Twitter has continued the culture of testing a new idea,
          or a feature among the users first before the launch.

          What's the morale of the story? Testing a product is important. But
          should that product be complete or barely functional? Here's where
          your MVP (minimum viable product) becomes crucial. That is easier said
          than done. Building an MVP that attracts investors enough to fund it
          is indeed a magic potion that is not complete without the right
          spells.

          There are three important principles of MVP building -

          The bigger idea behind building an MVP is to test your assumptions.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          Once you have identified the problem, done your research, you need to
          get into the business of building an MVP.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          Here are some important considerations while building an MVP that
          makes money -

      <div className="empathy-content">
        <h1 className="empathy-sub-heading">1. Create user profiles</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          While building an MVP, it is crucial to create user profiles based on
          which your product may be tested among the actual set of users.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Here are some things you may need to create these profiles -
          <div className="points">
            <p className="empathy-para">
              - Who is my user? Male, female, binary?
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              - What are his/her/their likes and dislikes?
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              - What do my target users do professionally?
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              - What do they do in their free time?
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">
              - Their income, their spending ability
            </p>
            <p className="empathy-para">- Their culture, language, age group</p>
          </div>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="empathy-content">
        <h1 className="empathy-sub-heading">2. Make a list of key features</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Based on the user’s persona, market research, and the problem to be
          solved, you will now have enough data to list key features of your
          product, service, or mobile application. Focus on the most essential
          features of your product. Think of it as a segregation of necessities,
          comforts, and luxuries. The most important features are those that
          will solve the most pressing part of the problem.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          For instance, for a taxi aggregator app, the most important features
          would be locating destinations, calling service, and listing
          registered drivers to drive taxis. The least important features would
          be add-ons such as a parcel delivery service or a profile photo of the
          users, etc.

        <h1 className="empathy-sub-heading">3. Create your MVP</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Instead of hiring expensive talent, teams, or resources, build a
          strong framework for your product or service first. And then train
          your existing team to build upon that framework. Once your team knows
          your vision, the target audience, and the solution, they will follow
          the process of MVP development in a more organized way. Create an
          agile development process based on constant user feedback, and learn
          as you go. Pay a lot of attention to the ease of use - be it an
          offline service or product, an app-based service or product - user
          experience and interface are the most crucial factors.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">4. Create a marketing strategy</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Identifying and building an important solution is one thing, marketing
          the same is quite another.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          For instance, the whole concept of carpooling has existed in the
          United States for a long time. But when Lyft was launched, it did not
          sell its service based on things like cost-saving, or time-saving
          features but on the concept of ‘ride sharing’. Even though the company
          was solving those problems, it marketed itself in a way to make
          carpooling an exciting experience to lure customers.

      <div className="empathy-content">
        <h1 className="empathy-sub-heading">5. Launch the product </h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          First, focus on delighting your customers instead of sales. It is
          important that a positive buzz be created around your product or
          service. Create a feedback loop to help you get consistent feedback on
          the product.Encourage your early users to rate your service or product
          or provide feedback for improvement. Actively seek suggestions, and
          analyze the feedback. The whole point of building an MVP is to learn
          and improve as you go. This initial feedback will help you
          course-correct sooner, so your MVP will be ready to show to the
          investors.
