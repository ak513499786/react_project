          Gadget Flow is a well-known product discovery platform that helps
          readers find latest tech and gear apart from information on unique
          crowdfunding campaigns.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          When Gadget Flow was founded back in 2012, the company had little
          competition in the product discovery domain. But as the internet grew
          with more information, the company felt an acute need to increase
          organic traffic. The company thought of an SEO strategy to boost its
          visibility on search engines.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          As the team researched, they realized that they needed to center their
          attention on content relevancy, a factor that was turning their
          readers/visitors away. Using some SEO tools, the company created a
          comprehensive plan for a site-wide content model, thus adding
          structured data such as reviews, blog posts, products, and videos.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The result? Gadget Flow claims that they were able to grow organic
          traffic by 185% for clicks on video content; and by 198% for news
          articles (within three months). Moreover, their review traffic
          increased, getting them 100% clicks. Whoa! That’s quite a success
          story now.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          What’s the bottom line? The internet is evolving quite fast, and so is
          SEO. You need to constantly stay on top of your online content, and
          the needs of your target audience.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">SEO - How did it all begin?</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Search engine optimization (SEO) has been around for over two decades,
          and it has undergone significant changes in that time. SEO is the
          practice of optimizing a website's content to rank higher in search
          engine results pages (SERPs) for specific keywords. With the rise of
          search engines like Google or Bing, SEO became an essential aspect of
          digital marketing. In the past, SEO primarily focused on technical
          aspects like keyword density and meta tags. Today, SEO is more
          holistic, focusing on providing value to users and creating
          high-quality content. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the
          changing nature of SEO.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">Early SEO era </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          In the early days of SEO, it was all about finding ways to manipulate
          search engines into ranking a website higher. This often involved
          keyword stuffing, buying links, and other black hat tactics that
          violated search engine guidelines. However, as search engines became
          more sophisticated, they began to penalize websites that engaged in
          these practices. Today, SEO best practices are focused on providing
          value to users and creating high-quality content.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">Emphasis on UX design </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          One of the biggest changes in SEO is the emphasis on user experience.
          In the past, SEO was focused on technical factors like keyword
          density, meta tags, and backlinks. Today, Google's algorithms are
          designed to reward websites that provide value to users. This means
          that websites with high-quality content, a great user experience, and
          relevant information will rank higher in search results.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">Local heroes </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Another change in SEO is the importance of local search. With the rise
          of mobile devices, people are increasingly using search engines to
          find businesses near them. This has led to the rise of local SEO,
          which focuses on optimizing a website's content to rank higher for
          local search queries. This includes optimizing a website's content for
          local keywords, creating local business listings, and ensuring that
          the website is mobile-friendly.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">Social media effect </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Social media has also had a significant impact on SEO. In the past,
          social media was seen as a separate marketing channel, but today, it
          is an essential part of any SEO strategy. Social media can help drive
          traffic to a website, increase brand awareness, and improve search
          rankings. By creating high-quality content that is shareable on social
          media, businesses can improve their SEO rankings and reach a wider
          audience.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">Voice search </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Voice search is also changing the nature of SEO. With the rise of
          voice assistants like Alexa and Siri, people are increasingly using
          voice search to find information online. This has led to the rise of
          conversational search, which focuses on optimizing a website's content
          for natural language queries. This means using long-tail keywords and
          answering questions directly in the content.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">Artificial intelligence </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Finally, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is also changing the
          nature of SEO. Google's algorithms are becoming increasingly
          sophisticated, using machine learning to understand the intent behind
          search queries. This means that SEO is becoming more about creating
          high-quality content that answers users' questions and provides value.
          AI is also being used to personalize search results, which means that
          SEO strategies will need to focus on creating personalized experiences
          for users.

            Moz is a well-known SEO software company that started as a blog. The
            company's founder, Rand Fishkin, used SEO to grow the blog's traffic

            launch Moz's SEO software business, which has grown into a
            multi-million dollar company.

        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">2. Focus on user experience</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          A website that is difficult to navigate or slow to load will have a
          negative impact on search rankings. Businesses must focus on creating
          a website that is easy to use, responsive, and fast.
