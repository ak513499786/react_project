          Since 1989, Intuit (maker of Quickbooks, Mint, and TurboTax) has run a
          “Follow me Home ” program that involves questionnaires, observations,
          interviews, etc. with the actual users at workplaces where Intuit’s
          products are being used. The goal of the program is to find out how
          customers use the product, what they like and don’t, and what
          challenges they may have.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          And what does Intuit do with all these insights? They change, modify,
          or tweak their products. Not kidding. For instance, the 2006 version
          of one of their products, Quicken, had 121 customer-recommended
          improvements. [Source]

          Harley-Davidson has carefully adjusted the voices of its motors to
          please its customers’ ears. In fact, they have sued competitors who
          have imitated their motor voices.

          The ability to get into your customers’ shoes results in user empathy.
          Intuit and Harley-Davidson are just two of the many companies
          worldwide that have mastered the art of empathy in User Experience
          (UX) design.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">What is Empathy?</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Empathy is a foundational principle in the concept of design thinking
          – a user-based approach to problem-solving that combines hands-on
          testing of a product or service with the actual users.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Empathy is thus a crucial factor in UX design because it involves the
          usability and function of products, and services in the environment of
          the users. Empathy allows product design teams to identify which ideas
          need more testing before they commit to a development or re-design
          project.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">Why is Empathy so important in UX?</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The story is told of a local cafe in London that was particularly
          concerned about the complaints the staff was getting about ‘really bad
          tea. The first and most obvious conclusion that the cafe owner made
          was that the chef was only three months old. But he couldn’t afford to
          fire the new chef. So the owner introduced the concept of MYOT (make
          your own tea) and put it on the menu. Those who opted for MYOT were
          given hot water in a teapot, a side of milk, sugar, and three kinds of
          tea leaves. The customers were also asked to set aside a tiny cup of
          the tea they made for the staff to taste later.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          After many MYOTs, the owner instructed the chef to brew two types of
          tea leaves, one stronger and one lighter. Interestingly, those who
          preferred a stronger tea had an Irish background, while those who
          preferred their tea lighter were mostly London natives.

          In case we haven’t made it obvious already, empathy is crucial in UX.
          However, it does not appear to come naturally to designers in general,
          and especially to UX designers. In fact, 2009 research stated that
          professionals working in the technology field have lower empathy. When
          there’s a disconnect between a designer and the end user, the product
          or application may fail.

          Here's Why Empathy Is Essential In UX Design-
        </h1>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">1 User Interactions</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          When Nielsen Norman Group’s co-founder Don Norman coined the term
          ‘user experience’ in the 1990s, empathy was at the heart of his
          definition. Norman said, "User experience encompasses all aspects of
          the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its
          products." By interaction Norman meant how a user fits your product
          into his environment or circumstances, and makes use of it.
          Empathizing with users involves studying their environment, living
          conditions, and preferences, among other things. These factors help UX
          designers get the users’ perspective during application development
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">2 Enhancing UX</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          UX is really about what users think, and feel. Human beings, by
          nature, are both emotional and rational. How a user perceives a
          product is never purely based on its features but also how he or she
          feels while using it. Empathy enables designers to infuse users’
          emotions while enhancing the user experience. Take for instance, the
          UX of Amazon’s smart devices, which is enhanced by the AI assistant
          Alexa because of its ability to interact in the users’ language, and
          gauge emotions. Amazon developers chose the name Alexa because it has
          a hard consonant with the ‘x’ , a factor that helps people of any
          language or ethnicity recognize the name with greater precision.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">3 Recognizing the context</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          You can never understand people’s circumstances unless you have been
          in similar situations yourself. Empathy pushes designers to go out of
          their way to understand the context as well as the relevance of the
          product within a user’s environment.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">4 Changing preferences</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Ongoing empathy towards users also leads to a deeper connection with
          users, where UX may be made intuitive based on the changing
          preferences of users. Just like how we saw it in Intuit’s feedback
          exercise, regular and active observations about customers'
          expectations have helped the company anticipate user needs and tweak
          products.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">Final thoughts</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Users are indeed changing every day. They are evolving with each new
          product, each new application, and each new feature. Millions of use
          cases are created unintentionally by users before companies. In this
          context, it is hard to imagine the user experience without user
          empathy. Creating user profiles, observing, prototyping, and testing
          are essential parts of empathetic design. Unless we learn to think and
          act like users, we cannot build lasting products that will always stay
          relevant. There’s no UX without empathy.
