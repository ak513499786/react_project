          Once upon a 2008, when a 28-year-old Londoner named Richard Pierson
          quit his job, and felt burned out even as a freelancer, he turned to a
          Buddhist monk named Andy Puddicombe. While Puddicombe taught Pierson a
          2,500-year-old meditation technique, the latter had a business idea.
          Both turned meditation into a successful local business in 2010.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          However, it was only when they converted this business into a
          meditation and wellness app that things really began to get global.
          Today, the app that the world knows as Headspace, has 11 million
          downloads, and around 400,000 paying subscribers.

          Question - Did switching from offline to online do the trick for the
          two local businessmen? Not at all.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          Headspace has a smooth user experience that instantly instills
          confidence. Mental health and wellness are not things that people
          easily trust. Headspace constantly gamifies the steps of meditation,
          offers tips and tricks, and helps users follow through on their goals.
          As a result, most users find themselves practicing meditation every
          single day, inspiring them to become paid subscribers for deeper
          transformation.

        <h1 className="empathy-h1">What is UX design?</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          This trend became a reality in 2022 when businesses saw Google’s AI
          search becoming more and more humane. As a result, content that really
          helped users or searchers began trending instead of keyword-heavy
          content. This will mature in 2023 as search engines evolve, and become
          more customer/user-oriented. It may be time you stop pleasing Google,
          and start pleasing your customers online.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          User Experience Design, or UX Design, is a term that is used to
          define, and design how users will navigate an application, product, or
          service. There was a time when UX design only meant the technical
          experience of users on a mobile application or a website. Today, UX
          design is carefully crafted when designing even physical products, or
          service experiences.We will keep our scope of discussion here for
          mobile, and web applications. UX involves bringing together the needs
          of the customers, and matching them with the technical aspects of any
          application.

          How does UX design impact the growth of SMEs?
        </h1>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">
          1. UX design increases conversions
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          For SMEs, the initial buzz around their product, or service helps them
          scale faster while also bringing them investment. Today, most
          customers will visit a business’ website or a service’s application to
          gain initial confidence. A good UX design will make them comfortable,
          and they will be inclined to buy that product or service. A
          significant challenge faced by Headspace UX designers initially was in
          onboarding more clients. They used relatable graphics that showed
          users doing meditation in their own zones such as workplace, kitchen,
          hobbies etc - a factor that significantly improved sales.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">
          2. UX design impacts brand loyalty
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          User experience speaks to the emotions of the users. When a business
          pays attention to the UX of their digital applications, users feel
          connected. This impacts their (users) subconscious minds and keeps
          them for a longer time. Retained customers become an annuity to a
          small business, and become its brand ambassadors.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">
          3. Saves run-up development costs
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          When SMEs focus on UX in the beginning of their product or service
          launch, they can practically save redesign and re-development costs
          considerably. Remember, it will cost you less to create a great user
          experience from scratch than it will to fix a poor UX.

          4. UX design lowers support cost
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          The reason why good website or mobile application development
          companies stress building a great UX design is because it ultimately
          saves support costs in the long run. When users are easily able to
          find what they are looking for, without getting distracted or
          overwhelmed by the design of the web or mobile application, they
          understand your product or service more quickly. This decreases the
          number of support tickets or calls that your executives will need to
          handle to answer users’ questions.

        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">
          5. Leads to right messaging, and Google ranking
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Very few SMEs realize the importance of their site or mobile app's
          Google ranking, and the kind of messaging that their app has. A smooth
          UX design helps put the most important messages or goals of your
          product in the right place. This also paves the way for best SEO
          practices that your website or mobile app may need, resulting in a
          better reach for your business on Google.

          6. Better understanding of your users
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Headspace designers consciously put in graphics, details, interface,
          and content language during UX design that normalized meditation for
          people. For instance, the team experimented with making the sign-up
          process easier; instead of a demo video, they simplified the usage of
          the app by using Gifs showcasing steps to use the app; and even added
          ‘Choose your own adventure’ option allowing users to choose how they
          wished to sign up. These small experiments in UX design at beta stage
          led to better understanding of users. Since the discipline of UX
          design begins with creating user profiles, and adding the right touch
          points for user purchases, this sends so much user data onto your
          dashboard to extract valuable insights for SMEs to benefit from.
