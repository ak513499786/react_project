          A few years ago, a Fortune 500 company called American Family
          Insurance (AFI) learned that more than half of Americans did not have
          the cash to cover a $400 emergency expense like a hospital trip, or a
          window repair. At first, the company thought Americans were in need of
          budgeting tools. However, when it actually sought customer feedback,
          they learned that most people were in need of keeping their savings
          aside to protect against the future.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          In one case, AFI reps and their design agency, IDEO sat with a working
          single mother of four in Tennessee and listened to her challenges
          about constrained budgets. To save money on childcare, and
          housekeeping, she had put her 11-year-old in charge of her younger
          siblings, partitioned snacks, and made chore charts for each child.
          AFI realized that she did not need another brand new financial
          management app or tool. She needed extra income cushions.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          After gathering similar feedback from several places across the United
          States, AFI launched Moonrise - a digital platform that allowed
          workers to sign up for shifts with partner organizations through a
          simple text message interface. Employers who signed up at Moonrise
          could list open shifts on the platform, and were liable to pay workers
          as soon as the shifts were done. Voila!
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Listening to customers led AFI to launch a whole new business. Within
          a few months of its launch in 2018, Moonrise had over 7,000 people
          applying for shifts, more than 7,000 shifts were fulfilled, and over
          $500,000 was paid to workers.

          When should you listen to your customers?

          When you want to establish expectations
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          A lot of businesses will wait until the product or service launch, and
          then get the first feedback from their customers. In order for your
          product or service to receive open arms from the customers, the
          feedback process must begin during the product design, and development
          process itself. Product testing is a vital step towards ensuring that
          you are launching your business to meet an actual need that exists in
          the market.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">
          When you want to improve your product
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Ongoing customer feedback is an integral part of business growth.
          Listening to customers is a great way to get real-time, actual
          feedback about how your product or service is doing. This is why
          companies such as AirBnB, Uber, or GrubHub, or e-commerce sites such
          as Amazon, ensure they have customer feedback instantly from the time
          of check-out until the product is delivered.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">When they are complaining</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          This should be a no-brainer, and yet many big and small businesses
          make the mistake of ignoring begrudged customers. Of course, not every
          complaint that you receive may be genuine, but many people wish to
          benefit from your return, exchange/service policies. However, it is
          always advisable to look into a complaint closely to see if there’s
          anything you are missing out on. Even when you receive too many false
          complaints, it is an indicator that your system, or CMS, needs
          improvement in filtering such complaints.
        </p>
        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">When you are not growing</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          In every business’ life, there comes a time when it hits a wall. When
          sales are steady, but not growing exponentially. This is the time to
          reach out to your customers, and re-establish their expectations. A
          great example is how car sports brand Nascar hit a wall back in 2018.
          When Steve Phelps came in as CEO, he helped create the Official Nascar
          Fan Council, which is a customer intelligence platform capturing fan
          insights from more than 12,000 viewers regularly. In addition, Nascar
          also partnered with Hewlett-Packard for a social media command center
          to get customer feedback in real time.

          Until 2014, Swarovski had been known around the world (apart from
          crystals) for producing iconic designs in their range of chandeliers.
          With the rise of interface technology, the company felt an acute need
          to catch up with the changing tastes of its customers.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          With the help of a noted design company, Swarovski acted upon customer
          feedback. The company launched Infinite Aura, that infused the
          Internet of Things (IoT) into their lighting offerings with a mobile
          app that allowed customers to modify light settings based on mood,
          time of day, occasion, etc. Listening to customers often helps your
          business reinvent, and diversify.

        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">
          When you should not listen to your customers
        </h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          In 1909, Harry Gordon Selfridge said, "The customer is not always
          right." Listening to customers is great for growth, improvement, and
          reinvention, but it is often not advisable for innovation since most
          people are resistant to change.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          There may also be circumstances where the customers may not know what
          they want, for example, in far-off, remote areas where technology or
          modern means have not reached, you may come across a business idea
          that is hard to test among people. In short, cultivating a habit of
          listening well while filtering out information that you don’t need is
          the way to go.
