          Only a decade ago, it was hard to imagine life without mobile apps.
          They now make our lives easier, with some even assisting us with our
          daily chores. Statista reports that mobile apps are expected to
          generate $935 billion in revenue globally in 2023.

          Businesses today need mobile apps faster, and they want apps that
          perform equally well across all the platforms. But do all businesses
          have the time and resources for the same?

          Enter React Native and Flutter - two of the most popular
          cross-platform mobile app development platforms.

          How did React and Flutter enter the mobile universe?
        </h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Facebook launched its open-source framework, called React Native back
          in 2015. It was the company’s attempt at equipping developers with a
          JavaScript-based framework for the development of cross-platform apps.
          React eliminates the need for compiling other technology stacks for
          mobile app development. Companies such as Uber Eats, Instagram, and
          Skype have since used React Native for their mobile app development
          needs.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          In 2017, Google launched an open-source User Interface (UI) framework
          that was targeted at aiding developers to design cross-platform apps
          to run on mobile, Windows, macOS, and Linux. Flutter’s framework is
          built upon Dart.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Soon after, many big companies such as Philips Hue, Hamilton, Alibaba,
          etc began developing mobile apps using Flutter. Ever since, Google has
          frequently provided updates for Flutter, improving its performance
          with each update.

        <p className="empathy-para">
          While native apps work better on mobile phones, developing native apps
          for each platform is quite a waste of time. As a result, businesses
          are always looking for technologies that would help them build
          cross-platform apps that would run as well, if not better, than native
          apps. Both React and Flutter offer open-source frameworks that solve
          this problem. Both the frameworks offer many tools and features, such
          as code reusability and Hot Reload with its ability to make changes on
          the fly etc - a freedom that makes mobile app development faster.

        <h2 className="empathy-sub-heading">React Native</h2>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Based on React.JS, React Native uses JavaScript to create mobile
          applications for iOS and Android. It also allows developers to develop
          apps using one codebase. React offers fast mobile application
          development and allows access to some third-party UI libraries with
          ready-to-use components. React also enables the delivery of new
          functionalities to supported platforms immediately.

          Flutter helps create cross-platform applications using a single
          codebase. So you don’t have to develop separate apps for mobile, web,
          and desktop. Being an open-source platform, any business owner can
          download it and get started. Apps built using Flutter are intuitive
          and easier to navigate.

          A wise step would be to study the metaverse as a user in 2023,

          business. It is okay if you don’t use the metaverse at all for digital

        <p className="empathy-para">
          <span className="opacity-80">Performance :</span> React uses
          JavaScript while Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which has
          a higher compilation rate than JS. As a result, Flutter’s apps deliver
          high performance by default. So if performance is one of your chief
          goals, you should choose Flutter.
        </p>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          <span className="opacity-80">Learning curve :</span> According to
          Statista, only 6.54% of developers use Dart that makes it harder to
          find Dart developers or for developers to learn the language. React
          has a shorter learning curve.

      <div className="empathy-content">
        <p className="empathy-para">
          <span className="opacity-80">Testing :</span> For testing a React
          Native app, you will need a third-party testing framework such as
          Detox. If that’s a challenge, then it is better to choose Flutter
          because it is enriched with integrated testing features.
        </p>
        <h1 className="empathy-h1">Final thoughts</h1>
        <p className="empathy-para">
          Statista states that 38% of developers used React Native in 2021,
          whereas 42% used Flutter for development. However, you should make a
          decision based on your overall goals in terms of your cross-platform
          mobile app development needs. If you need help or advice on what’s
